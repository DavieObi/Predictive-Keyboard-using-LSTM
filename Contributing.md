# Contributing to Predictive Keyboard using LSTM

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Predictive Keyboard using LSTM** project!  
This repository is focused on building a next-word prediction / keyboard-auto-complete system powered by LSTM deep learning and natural language processing. Every contribution — whether small or large — is welcome and appreciated.

## 🏆 How You Can Contribute

- **Data Expansion & Pre-processing**: Add or refine language corpora, include more training text, enhance tokenization or embed more features (e.g., sequences, user-context).  
- **Model Improvements**: Try different architectures (LSTM, GRU, Transformer), tune hyperparameters, improve accuracy, reduce latency.  
- **Inference & Deployment**: Improve the real-time prediction/inference engine, build the UI/UX for the predictive keyboard, optimize for performance.  
- **Visualization & Reporting**: Add dashboards, confusion matrix visuals, performance metrics, comparisons of model versions.  
- **Documentation**: Clarify how to run the system, add usage examples, step-by-step guides, code comments, or tutorial notebooks.  
- **Testing & Reproducibility**: Ensure the pipeline runs end-to-end, add example inputs/outputs, test latency, include reproducible notebooks or scripts.
